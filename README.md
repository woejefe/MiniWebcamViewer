I wanted a way to display an NDI input for program and preview windows, or just to monitor a video input in a borderless window

Opens first webcam input on main screen in 360x180 window... Alt+F4 to exit... it always stays on top

Works great with TouchOSC to preview a window if using for video mixer . Just drag into position
