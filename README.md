# MiniWebcamViewer / Pip-Window (used for NDI/OBS webcam viewer)

I wanted a way to display an NDI input for program and preview windows, or just to monitor a video input in a borderless window

Opens first webcam input on main screen in 360x180 window... Alt+F4 to exit... it always stays on top

Works great with TouchOSC to preview a window if using for video mixer . Just drag into position

You can use it as a monitor to see whats happening in on other devices/streams/ basically whatever you can pipe into a webcam input


Currently want a way to pick the source

Dependencies are pillow, imutils, tkinter, and C2V
